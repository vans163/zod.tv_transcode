## What are drones 

Drones are workers that fill transcode orders.  A drone fleet could be for example operated by 
EVE who has a specilized proprietory VP9 encoder, just as well as a drone could be operated by Bob,
that crypto miner who bought your mining rig for full price right before crypto winter started and 
is trying to recouperate.
