# Zod.TV - Transcode
Decentralized Video Transcoder

## What is it?

Decentralized Video Transcoder priced by supply / demand market of CPUs / GPUs / FPGAs / Algorithm advantages.  

## What does this project contain/use/exemplify?

- Functional Component React with Hooks for state (no Redux yay!)
- ed25519 to Curve25519 conversion plus encrypt/decrypt with shared secret
- smart contract based queue of jobs

## What is missing?

- Drone support
- ?

## What are drones 

Drones are workers that fill transcode orders.  A drone fleet could be for example operated by 
EVE who has a specilized proprietory VP9 encoder, just as well a drone could be operated by Bob,
that crypto miner who bought your mining rig for full price just as crypto winter started and 
is trying to recouperate.

## Why use this?

If you have videos to transcode, you can save a fortune while retaining quality and most important, 100% privacy (no one can peek at your videos or api keys, not even the drone working on it).  
Zod.TV Transcoder built on NEAR Protocol is more secure than AWS Elastic Encoder.    

If you have a technological advantage, like a custom encoder you wrote. Monetize it immediately.  
If you have a special FPGA that you developed, make your research profitable.  
If you have idle CPUs/GPUs/FPGAs. Monetize them immediately.  
If you have NVIDIA GPUs for mining, dual/tri mine. Video Encoder ASIC on NVIDIA GPU does not use CUDA cores at all.
